These are personal lecture notes prepared from reading the textbooks. 
They are not meant to be distributed but for my personal book keeping. 
For me, I never or barely look at notes I took in class. 
So while I was taking these classes, I don't even bother.
It's notes that I prepared off class help me understand the materials the most.
