These are personal lecture notes prepared from reading the textbooks. 
They are not meant to be distributed but for my personal book keeping. 
For me, I never or barely look at notes I took in class. 
So while I was taking these classes, I don't even bother.
It's notes that I prepared off class help me understand the materials the most.

If you have leisure of reading them by any chance and find any mistakes 
please kindly let me know. Any suggestions are welcome!
